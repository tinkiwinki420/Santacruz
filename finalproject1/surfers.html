          <h2>Filipe Toledo</h2>
          For his whole professional career, Filipe Toledo has represented the
          tip of the spear of the progressive surfing movement. Small in
          stature, but massive with his moves, especially in the aerial realm,
          this Brazilian tornado’s heart-pounding approach has netted him 10
          Championship Tour victories since his CT debut in 2013.

          <h2>Gabriel Medina</h2>
          At home in Brazil, the enigmatic goofyfooter is considered a national
          hero thanks to the World Titles he delivered to the proud surfing
          nation in 2014, 2018, and 2021. His homecoming to São Paulo was
          national news after an epic win at Pipeline for his second title, and
          to this day Medina has a tough time going anywhere in Brazil without
          being recognized.

          Growing up in Coolum, on Australia's Sunshine Coast, Nichols began
          surfing at age nine and realized she wanted to become a pro surfer
          four years later. In 2015 she claimed the Australasia Junior Tour
          title and didn’t drop a heat on the way to winning the World Junior
          Championships in 2016.

          <h2>Stephanie Gilmore</h2>
          Stephanie Gilmore has been one of the most dominant surfers in
          history. She won the first of her seven World Titles during her 2007
          rookie season, becoming the first surfer on either the Men’s or
          Women’s side to accomplish such a feat. It would be her first of four
          straight she would collect during her rapid takeover of the sport.
